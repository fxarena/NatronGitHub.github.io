Natron {{page.version}} is here!  This release adds some fixes to various quality of life issues.

## Major Changes

- Error messages are not cleared anymore at each rendered frame. They can be cleared explicitely using the "Refresh" button in the viewer.
- ReadSVG: Fix reading layers of SVG files. [#292](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/292)
- Fix many G'MIC plugins. Changes are not backward compatible and existing graphs may need to be reworked. Note that G'MIC plugins are still beta. [#295](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/295)
- LensDistortion: fix loading PFBarrel files. [#296](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/issues/296)
- Label parameters now use both columns in the parameters panel.

## Known Issues

### Windows
- If Natron is not installed in Program Files using the installer, the Text node does not work because fontconfig does not initialize properly.
