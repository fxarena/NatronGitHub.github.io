OpenFX (OFX), a.k.a. [The OFX Image Effect Plug-in API](http://openfx.sourceforge.net/), is an open standard for 2D visual effects or compositing plug-ins. It allows plug-ins written to the standard to work on any application that supports the standard. The OpenFX standard is owned by The Open Effects Association, and it is released under a 'BSD' open source license. OpenFX was originally designed by Bruno Nicoletti at The Foundry Visionmongers.

Natron is part of ``Member Companies`` at [The Open Effects Association (OFX)](http://openeffects.org/), a non-profit organization, develops and promotes open standards across the visual effects community.

The Associationâ€™s initial focus is to improve the OpenFX image processing plug-in standard. This goal of this standard is to reduce development effort and support needed for plug-ins across different compositing and editing host platforms.
